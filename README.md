I embarked on this journey to enhance my skills in web development.

This comprehensive project allowed me to dive into various technologies and frameworks. 

♦️MySQL as the database, 
♦️SpringBoot for building the backend, 
♦️React for frontend
♦️Postman for testing API endpoints
♦️Spring_Tool_Suite 
♦️VS_Code  

Throughout the development process, I encountered numerous challenges that helped me strengthen my problem-solving abilities and improve my coding practices. From setting up the database schema to implementing CRUD operations, each step pushed me to expand my knowledge and refine my skills.

The end result is a fully functional Employee Management system that enables users to create, read, update, and delete employee records. The application provides a seamless user experience with a clean and intuitive interface built using React.
